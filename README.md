# Web Scraper


## About
In this project, I write a web scraping script that issues an HTTP request to a Job posting website URL, parses the response, performs a little data cleaning, 
and checks the number of times different programming languages are mentioned in the post. The results are plotted on bar graph.


## Background
I have recently been curious to know how web scraping works. 
Luckily, I found a beginner-friendly youtube tutorial that walks through the process of creating a web scraping script.
The code in this project is my code from following that Youtube tutorial. 
I am so excited to not just see a dictionary of the scrapped data but a graphical representation of the results
